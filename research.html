              I read many <a class="link-class" href="../assets/files/StanceDetectionPapers.bib">papers</a> which were related to Stance Detection. After a while, I got interested in Adversarial
              Networks. So, I decided to continue my research by combining these two ideas in order to generalize the
              stance detection model. The full report of the project is <a class="link-class" href="../assets/files/VQA_report.pdf">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-class">
              <b>NOTE:</b> This was a great project and three teams (VQA, Medical Image Classification, and Stance Detection) were working on it.

            <p class="title-class">Claim Extraction</p>
            <p class="text-class">
              In this project, I helped a senior student in her Bachelor of Science Thesis. We searched for <a class="link-class" href="../assets/files/ClaimExtractionPapers.bib">possible ways</a> that can extract sub-claims from a complex claim. Because it was a difficult task to
              gather data for it, we decided to use zero and few-shot learning. We prepared a small dataset for this purpose. You can see the thesis <a class="link-class" href="../assets/files/BSc_Thesis_Zahra_Hosseini_96531226.pdf">here</a>.
