<p>
    My name is Babak Behkamkia, and I am a senior student at the Iran University of Science and Technology (<b>GPA:3.79/4</b>). 
    My IELTS score is <b>7.5</b> (L: <b>8.5</b>, R: <b>7.5</b>, W: <b>6.5</b>, S: <b>6.5</b>)
    I am interested in topics about <b>NLP</b>, such as stance detection, claim extraction, and fake news detection. 
    In addition, <b>GANs</b> and using <b>adversarial networks</b> in order to generalize the domain, are of great interest to me.
